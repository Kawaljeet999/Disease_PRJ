This repository provides an implementation of an early disease detection model using machine learning. The model is trained on a dataset where symptoms are represented as binary values (0 and 1), with additional categorical features. The goal is to accurately predict the presence of diseases based on symptom input.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes features such as binary symptom indicators (`0` and `1`) along with categorical features that represent other relevant characteristics. The training data is stored in `df_1`, and the test data in `df_2`.

## Requirements
To run this notebook, the following Python packages are required:
- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `numpy` for numerical operations
- `scikit-learn` for machine learning model building and evaluation
- Any other dependencies mentioned in the notebook cells

Install the required packages using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```

2. Open and run the `Disease_Detection.ipynb` notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Disease_Detection.ipynb
   ```

3. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Model Training
The model is designed to detect diseases based on the provided features. A gradient boosting model is used as the base learner to leverage ensemble learning techniques, aiming for improved accuracy in predictions.

### Key Steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for training by handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables.
2. **Model Selection**: Gradient boosting is used as the primary model, selected for its strong performance in structured datasets.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Adjusts model parameters for optimal performance, although specifics on tuning are discussed in the notebook.

## Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated based on accuracy and F1 score, with comparisons to baseline models where applicable.

## Results
The final model achieves a high accuracy on the test set, demonstrating effectiveness in early disease detection based on symptom inputs.

## Future Work
- Experiment with additional ensemble methods for further accuracy improvements.
- Consider additional feature engineering techniques to enhance model robustness.
- Test the model on external datasets to evaluate its generalizability.
